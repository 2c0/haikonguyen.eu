Well after the purchase and the [review](http://haihanguyen.eu/?p=303) of the legendaryÂ lens Canon FD 100mm SSC F2.8, I knew I would have to buy another Canon FD lens, because these lenses are so good, yet so affordableÂ right now.

So this time, I was looking for a longer telephoto prime lens, I didn't want a zoom lens, because I know that Canon started to produce high quality zoom lens just recently and boy they are really BIG and expensive (especially the L series with bigger apperture, like the famous 70-200mm F2.8 IS mark II, in my country the Czech republic, the prices are around 65000 czech crowns, that is around 2600 $ USD). So again, I looked at the famous old school FD primes line up, and finally found two candidates to choose from:

So after deep research, I decided to ditchÂ the F2.8 variationÂ for the smaller package and bought the F4 version.

Even though, I know that faster lens would give me much more creative options, this time I really need a light small package. Why? BecauseÂ my primary goal for this lens is to capture architecture and portraits (especially on the streets) and I want to be able to carry my camera with the lens for longer duration and also try to be less intimidating, when taking pictures of people on the streets.

I think I made a good choice, because the lens served my purposes very well, I would say even beyond my imagination, but again, I mentioned this statement also with my Canon FD 100mm F2.8 SSC (see the review [here](http://haihanguyen.eu/?p=303)). I paid 1300 Czech crowns ( around $53Â USD), that makes this lens the cheapest and most efficient lens I ever bought ðŸ˜€. For the price and quality you can get, for me nothing comes close to this amazing lens at this moment.

So in this section I am going to make a short review of this beautiful lens:

**Optics â€”-> 4/5**

- sharp wide open at F4, although not super fast like F1.8 or faster lenses
- color rendition is superb
- beautiful bokeh
- great for portrait â€“> especially headshots and tight headshots
- there is some chromatic aberration at F4, but can be easily removed in Lightroom or Photoshop
- this lens is great for getting closer to a subject, so you can take pictures from distance, which is very useful for street photography and also landscapes as well

**Build and Ergonomics â€”-> 4/5**

- its a Japanese gem (Made in Japan 1979)
- the build is very good, but not as good as the old FD lenses, which were built like tanks
- the focus ring on this lens is the smoothest I've ever used (butterly smooth ðŸ˜€, even more than the old FDs)
- only manual â€“ so its hard to get the focus right, especially for moving subjects
- full manual (focus and aperture), no metadata information about f-stop whatsoever
- need a proper adapter to use
- not good for fast actions like sport

**Price/Performance â€”-> 5/5**

- superb quality lens
- cheap price â€“ I paid 95USD with shipping
- fun to shoot with

Â 

**Verdict:**

This lens managed to beat even myÂ lovely Canon FD 100mm F2.8 SSC that I reviewed just recently. So now it becomes the cheapestÂ lens Iâ€™ve ever bought and also the best buy ever, period. This lens is a beast performer and gem from Canon. Â After almost 40 years, its still performs as a champ.Â If you are on a budget and lookingÂ for an outstanding telephoto lens, then this lens is a must buy. Of course you need to sacrifice autofocus and metadata :-).
