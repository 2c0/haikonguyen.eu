Prague Main Train Station is my favourite location for shooting portraits especially when I really don't have any plans and just want to shoot some pictures. Btw, this place is also the most beautiful train station in the Czech Republic. I also just recently found out that the famous movie director Michael Bay shot his [Victoria Secret 2011 commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fezSqm7z8Ls "VS 2011") here.

I really enjoy to shoot here during night time, because there is so many tiny colour light sources that creates beautiful bokeh background for potraits.

I also really enjoy teaching photography for beginners here at night, because there is so many opportunities for me teach them the basic PHOTOGRAPHY TRIANGLE.

As you can guess by now, I'm really kind of a low light photo fan boy and the Prague Main Station is one of my favourite spot :-).

Here are some samples from my latest workshops:
