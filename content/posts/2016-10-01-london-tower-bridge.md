Recently, I had a chance to visit London, one of the most international, modern, yet classy city on Earth.

London has been the place where most famous writers, musicians, actors and many more artist wereborn, and since the Industrial Revolution, The British capital has been one of the wealthiest cities in the world.

During my short visit, I had a chance to take a picture of Tower Bridge, which is one of the most iconic symbol of London.

Well, I must admit, when I was going to take the picture, the process was not going as smoothly as I thought it would be, and this shot was one of the toughest image I ever took. In this case, the reason was not the risk of danger, but actually my own fault. Why? Well, despite of knowing the weather forecast and my time limitation in London, I came late to the destination and that is the worst mistake I could make. When I finally arrived at the Tower Bridge, I knew that if I don't take the picture then, I will not have any opportunities anymore. Well, at least not until the next visit. At first, I was so stressed and disappointed, but when I finally saw the beautiful bridge standing in front of me, I realized that I could not give up, I calmed down, switched back to my relaxed photo mood, took the picture and knew that it will be ok.

I got lucky this time, learned my lesson and will not make the same mistake again.

Actually you can enjoy this beautiful scenery with me and see it for yourself.

Thank you and Best Regards,

Your boy, Haiko :-).
