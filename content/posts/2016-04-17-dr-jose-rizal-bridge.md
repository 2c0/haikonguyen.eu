This is one is the most difficult picture I’ve ever taken. Why? Well, it was not about the composition, technical issues or weather(even though, the weather could be tad better).

It was about the place where I had to take the picture. In other words, let’s just say I’m quite afraid of heights and the famous Dr. Jose Rizal bridge I was standing on, is really high, at least for my taste.

I like to travel light these days, so I don’t bring my BIG TRIPOD anymore, instead I just bring my trusty Gorilla-pod with me. So in this case, it was the worst combo for me, because I had to force myself to stand near the short fence and boy it was scary. If you are afraid of heights like me, you know what I’m talking about.

On the bridge, there is only tiny place for pedestrians, so the cars are literally surrounding you and you can feel them, because the bridge is always trembling and shaking, especially when the bigger cars are around. The weather that day was nice, but cold and windy and imagine if you had to stand on that bridge for the whole 1 hour with all the things that I mentioned.

Well, it was a challenge for me, for sure. After first five minutes, I just put on my noise cancellation headphones, play my favourite music and imagine how the final picture would look like and here is the result.

Thank you for reading, enjoy and have a great night everybody !
