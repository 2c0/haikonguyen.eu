Hi guys,

it's my first post ever, and today I want to share with you few reasons, why I switched from Canon EOS DSLR to Sony Alpha Mirrorless system.

So I was a long time Canon shooter (for about 5 years now) and Canon was really great, during this time, I had an opportunity to work with 2 Canon bodies. The famous Canon EOS 50D (my first DSLR) and the 600D (my second precious). Both of them were really great and until recently I consider the 600D to be the best all around DSLR for the price. Especially what it can do for photos and video.

So I saved up some money and was looking for new replacement of my beloved 600D. So my requirements we following:

- High MPx sensor
- Great low light performance
- Fast autofocus
- Great video
- Within 1000 USD range
- Tilf-swift display

At first there were 2 candidates from Canon, that was hot on my list. The famous Canon 70D and the latest 7D mark II. Both of them are considered the best APS-C bodies in Canon lineup, and they still are. So I already knew the specs of the 70D, because it was on sale for a while, but I was really looking for a 7D mark II. So I patiently waited for the announcement from Canon and the 7D mark II did not offer many new stuff (at least for me though). Many Canon film makers (including myself) were hoping for internal 4K recordings, but was disappointed again. But you know, it's the Canon way of releasing new technology. Canon tends to release the newest technology for the most expensive bodies first (like Canon 1DX then to the lower models later). So after this announcement I was going to save more money and hope for better future Canon bodies. Until this moment I was still loyal to Canon brand (some might say that I was a fanboy, well maybe I was). I knew about Sony cameras and also other brands like Panasonic, Olympus and Fuji. Well to be honest there was moment that I thought about switching to Fuji X100s. This Camera is amazing for few reasons:

- APS-C sensor, which means super image quality (identical to Canon or Nikon DSLRs)
- Lightweight small body - well you may say something like "small bodies are for amateurs" or something around those lines (I used to say that :-))
- One of the best design for camera that I've seen - retro look like famous Leica

But as you may guess, there also few cons (at least for me):

- no interchangeable lenses
- the Video on X100s was not that great
- bit pricey

Thats why I decided to stick with Canon. So how did I found out about Sony? Well I am a fan of Sony Playstation, Xperia phones and Walkman, I also regularly watch Sony news and one day I clicked a link to the now breathtaking Sony A7s. I was amazed by its lowlight capabilities and performance in Video, but wasn't so sure about pictures, because it has "only" 12mpx sensor. So I decided to browse Youtube for reviews about Sony E-mount mirrorless systems and one day I found this review video from Jason Lanier, where he talks about why he switched to Sony from Nikon:

- [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wM_5nROeaw "10 reasons to switch to Sony")

I watched his entire video and literally blown away by the facts about Sony cameras. I really like his story, because he's a professional photographer and spent like thousands of dollars on gear already, but the funny thing is that even though Canon and Nikon make you pay more, does not mean you get more! And from this moment I was really into Sony, I watched more of Jason Videos, in fact I subscribed to his channel (he's really cool guy and I like his style). I was really excited about Sony, so I searched more and more about the System and reviews from other youtubers. After few days I was really determined to sell all my Canon stuff and I bought my lovely Sony A6000 camera with the superb potrait lens from Sony (SEL 50 F1.8)

I recommend you to watch Jason\`s video, because my reasons to switch are identical to Jason's and I think that it would be for any photographer once they find the potential of Sony cameras:

1. Small and beautiful body (I bought the Silver version, but the X100s is still the King in design)
2. Packed with features (electronic viewfinder, wifi, apps, zebra, peaking and many more)
3. Cheaper compare to Canon or Nikon system
4. With an adapter you could use any lens
5. Great image sensor
6. Great image quality
7. Great video
8. And superb lenses, but the best one are quite Expensive (all Zeiss lenses)

It was a tough call, but I can say that It was one of the best decision I made in my photography profession.

For me Sony is the best Camera brand for now, we'll see if in the future Canon, Nikon or other manufacturers can keep up or make even better gear :-).

So if you like, you can comment down about Sony cameras, discuss about what brand do you use and why? Let me know if you are going to switch or not?
