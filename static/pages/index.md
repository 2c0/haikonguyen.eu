    ## HI, I'M HAIKO
    
    Hello dear friend! Welcome to my personal blog. On this site you you can find my latest post primarly about things that are dearest to my heart.
    The main topics are usually tech related, such as DEVELOPMENT (mostly Web, because I'm a web-developer), PHOTOGRAPHY, TRAVEL, VLOGS, GAMING and my personal stories.
    As I am self-taught developer and photographer, I would like to share throughout my writings my personal experience, and maybe inspire more people to learn in our SUPER FAST PACE WORLD :-).
