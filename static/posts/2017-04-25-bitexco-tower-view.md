If you are in Saigon and don't know where to take your lover, you should definitely visit the Bitexco tower, 
and it's Sky Bar, It is a great place to have a date and see the city from another point of view. 
If you are a photographer, you are going to basically kill two birds with one stone.
Just remember to come before sunset ðŸ˜Ž!
