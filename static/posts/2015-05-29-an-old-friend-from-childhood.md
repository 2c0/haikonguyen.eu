Hi guys,

so I just recently met my old friend from childhood. We used to be students in the same Tae Kwon Do school called Sonkal Prague (actually I think nowadays its one of the most notable ITF Tae Kwon Do school in Czech Republic). So he, myself and other old members of this Tae Kwon Do school were really closed, because as a students we used to train every day together, spent most of our time to train and competing against other schools in Czech National Tae Kwon Do tournaments. Some of our friends and colleagues even managed to compete in International Tournaments (yeah not me tough, but believe it or not I won some silver and bronze medals in Czech National Tournaments :-)).

So after most of us left Tae Kwon Do and go to make our dream come true (like Graduate Universities, get Great Paid Job and so on..), most of us stayed in contact thanks to Facebook.

One day this guy just contacted me and asked me if I can take some pictures of him and his beautiful fiancee. So I said sure thing man, and gladly accept is offer.

And here are some pictures we took, we did not have much time, because he was already planned a party at his beautiful flat, but at least I managed to snap something :-).
