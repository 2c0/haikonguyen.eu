Independence Palace

It’s been exactly 42 years, since the North Vietnamese Tanks crushed the main gate of the Presidential Palace of South Vietnam (nowadays Independence Palace or Reunification Palace). That day was a memorable day for Vietnamese people, because after almost 20 years of pain and sorrow, the War had finally ended and the Vietnamese nation could finally unite and celebrate.

I’ve recently visited the ex-south Vietnamese capitol, and I am so glad that this beautiful Palace was not destroyed during the war, because it is really gorgeous. Today it looks almost the same if not better than 42 years ago. If you ever visit Ho Chi Minh City, this spot should be definitely on top of your list.

In meantime, enjoy the beautiful front view of the Palace.
