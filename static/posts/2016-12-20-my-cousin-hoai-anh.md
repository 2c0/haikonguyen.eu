One of the most difficult challenge for a potrait photographer is a situtation, when there is not enough light around.

Of course, one can bring additional light sources like Speedlights or Rotolights with some light diffusers, but a photographer would still need an assistant to help you out, well at least I do, when I want to get the best results.

I did not have any Speedlights with me this time, neither have any friend or assistant who could help holding the the lights. It was just me and my cousin walking on the Trang Tien street. Fortunately for us, there was a beautiful soft light coming from the local shopâ€™s window, so I told her to stand next to it and do some posing, she managed like a pro.
