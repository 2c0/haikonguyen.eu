Bangkok is an amazing city, to describe it would take me ages.

Fortunately for me, it was already done by Thai ancestors before:

_"The city of angels, the great city, the residence of the Emerald Buddha, the impregnable city (of Ayutthaya) of God Indra, the grand capital of the world endowed with nine precious gems, the happy city, abounding in an enormous Royal Palace that resembles the heavenly abode where reigns the reincarnated god, a city given by Indra and built by Vishnukarn."_

Have a great evening guys!
