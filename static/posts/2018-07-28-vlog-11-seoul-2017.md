Checkout my new Vlog, shot in Seoul! One of the biggest economy of the World. Lately this country has advanced so much,
it's hard to tell, what to dislike about this proud nation. This is a city, where everyone can find what they want, it is
the new standard of Advanced Asian Cities, this is the new Tokyo. Trust me, I can't get enough of this city!

Have a look and see for yourself, enjoy!
