Ho Chi Minh City aka Saigon is truly an amazing city. Historically the City has been occupied by so many nationalities Khmer, French, Japanese, Americans and lastly Vietnamese. That is also the reason, why this city is so diverse and multicultural nowadays.

The Unique diversity is also connected with multi-religions and in the city, you can find muslim mosque, buddhist and tao temples, and of course the catholic churches represented also by the famous Saigon's Notre Dome.

If you happened to be a foodie like me, you owe yourself to visit this place, because this is a really food paradise. It will take you weeks to eat all the delicious Vietnamese plates here, not to mention Indian, Japanese, Korean and Thai food as well.

No wonder, so many people want to visit this place and thanks to that, the population of the city is around 10 mil., and it is still growing.

Since 1975 after the event so called “The Fall of Saigon”, this city has grown so much, and has become the largest city and the economic centre of Vietnam.

After my visit in Singapore, I can see the similarities between these two cities already, and I think Saigon can become the next Singapore within next ten years, well that is just my personal prediction, but we would have to wait and see that.

For now just enjoy this beautiful view into the City and Bitexco Tower.

Happy New Lunar Year everybody!
