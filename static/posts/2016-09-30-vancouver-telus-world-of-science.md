I spent only a short time in this lovely Canadian city, but boy oh boy, what a beauty she is. When I was in the city, I had a feeling like I was walking in the Europe not in Canada, because Vancouver reminds me the old Continent so much. This city is so beautiful, yet so calm. The city has beautiful nature, yet it is so modern. The people here like to sail, so there are so many boats and yachts just floating around.

If you are like me and love the Asian cousine, then this is the place to go. After a delicious meal, you could take your lover to the place called Science World to watch the glowingly Globe with yachts in the background.

Here is a just little taste, enjoy and have great rest of the weekend guys!
