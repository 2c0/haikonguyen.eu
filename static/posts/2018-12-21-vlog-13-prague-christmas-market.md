It's christmas here in Prague, and I told myself, it's been a while, since I've done any Vlogs. Usually, I try to make
English speaking version, but there are so many of them on youtube already, so cause I am also a Vietnamese, why not
make a video about Christmas mood here in Prague, and show my family, how the Christmas atmosphere here in Prague is 
not behind any major Cities in the world.

BTW, if you are not native Vietnamese, turn on the subs through the "CC" button in the youtube player, enjoy! :-)
