Ha Long Bay is the Vietnamese jewel and One of the Seven World Natural Wonders.

The legend says that thousands years ago, a Mighty Dragon was sent by God from heaven to save the vietnamese people against invaders. That's actually where the name comes from, because Ha Long (下龍) literally means "Dragon Descending"

There are actually around 2000 islands, but vietnamese government decided to choose number 1969. Why? Well that's because this number is taken from the year 1969, when our national hero and beloved Uncle Ho (president Ho Chi Minh) passed away.

Well, that is actually all what I've remembered from the lecture of our tour guide guy.

Anyway enjoy this beautiful view and goodnight guys!
