The weather in Czech Republic was really beautiful and warm yesterday.  It was really unusual to see such a beautiful day during winter season, especially in Prague. It was around 15 degrees Celsius and that’s almost identical to Vietnam Hanoi (around 15 - 18 degrees), but that’s a pretty normal for winter season in Hanoi.

 

So because yesterday was such a beautiful day, I decided to take a picture from a different point of view. Even though this gorgeous scenery to Prague Castle from the Old Town Bridge Tower is quite famous, I never had a chance to literally go up and take a picture. Today I can say, that I am really glad, that I did. :-D

 

If you are going to climb the stairs and take a picture here as well, you will need to remember two things:

 

1. you will need to pay the fee around 90 Czech crowns (around 3 Euros)
2. once you managed to climb on top, the highest tiny floor will be packed with tourists, so it’s going to be quite a challenge to take a picture here
    - you can definitely forget about the classic big tripods and monopods here :-D

 

I’ve been living in Prague my whole life and, I am still amazed, how beautiful and romantic the city is. I hope you will like the picture and have a nice evening!
