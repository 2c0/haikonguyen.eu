The World has so many wonderful places, but Prague will always stay in my heart as my mother city. It is a town where I grew up and learned how to become the person I am now.

Even despite the fact that Iâ€™ve been living here all my life, whenever I have a chance to walk through the Old Town, I can't help but to stop, stare and praise how gorgeous the city is. In fact, it's so wonderful that sometimes I have a goosebumps feeling just thinking about this masterpiece. It is like having a fairy tale in real life.

Prague is such a gorgeous city. It is so classy, romantic, peaceful and calm. If you ever want to visit Europe, you should definitely pay a visit, because it is so worth it!
