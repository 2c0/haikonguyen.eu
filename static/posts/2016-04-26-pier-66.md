I think that every city has a spot called “hidden gem” and #Pier 66 is definitely one of them. When I arrived at the location the first time, I was so amazed by the beauty of this place, unfortunately that day was little bit rainy and I could not find the proper angle.

I liked the place so much that I knew I would have to come back and take the better shot. I was fortunate enough to succeed on the second try and boy what a view it was. Of course you would have to experience it personally to really enjoy the thing, but I tried really hard to bring you the same feeling that I had.

To be honest that day I was really sad, but when I saw this beautiful view, I just wished that everybody would be able see it, because the scenery there was so gorgeous.

If I have to choose the most romantic place in Seattle, #Pier66 would definitely be on the top of my list.

I hope you like the photo and have a great day!
