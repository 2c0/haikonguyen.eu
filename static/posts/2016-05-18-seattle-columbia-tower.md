If you are in Seattle, you probably would wanna go to visit either the famous Space Needle or the Columbia Tower Observatory, and if you are lucky enough, you can go to both places altogether.

In my case, I just managed to buy a ticket only for the Sky View Observatory (aka Columbia Tower), but boy oh boy, what a spectacular view it was.

When you are there, just make sure that:

- you arrive on the best time of the day,
- it is not raining,
- choose your best angle,
- and enjoy the beautiful VISTA.

Thank you and Good Night guys!
