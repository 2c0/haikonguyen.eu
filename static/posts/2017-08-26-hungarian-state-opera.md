he State Opera in Budapest is one of the most beautiful opera houses in the world. It is a proud memory of once the most powerful empire on earth.

I was lucky enough to take this breathtaking view of the interior. In middle, you can see the section where the Austrian-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph used to sit and watch the Opera performances. All the decorations are handmade with top quality materials like expensive wood and gold. The architecture and paintings were designed by the most renowned artist during that time.

Enjoy the view and if you can, definitely visit this amazing place!
