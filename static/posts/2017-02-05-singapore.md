The Lion City aka Singapore nowadays even without the natural resources, is one of the Four Asian Tigers, an economic multinational power, has one of the biggest financial center in the world and it is considered as one of the cleanest cities on Earth.

Looking back in the history, this country has changed so much during last two centuries. Literally from a swamp to the British colonial port and finally into today’s World Metropolis. It was not always easy for this country to develop into today’s super modern city, but Singapore managed to do it against all odds.For all the things that happened to the country, the Singaporean people are very grateful to two important men.

First gratitude was given to all the the efforts of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles aka the founder of Singapore, who consistently believed that Singapore would be, one day, the international British Trade Port. Raffles eventually succeeded and Singapore became one of the most important British Colonial Trade Port. After the succesful establishment, Raffles was summoned back to Sumatra and Singapore governance was left to William Farquhar who did not seem to care about Singapore much and during is reign, the country took over the bad British influences from mainland China including Opium distribution, prostitution and crime. Raffles later came back to Singapore, blame Farquhar and basically cancel him from the position. After Raffles died, Singapore remained as a British colony until 1959.

In 1959, a young man and brilliant law student of the Cambridge University, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew was elected as the first Prime Minister of Singapore. This politician was considered by all Singaporeans as founding father of modern Singapore. He wanted to make Singapore completely indenpendent from the British government and during the time in his office, he basically transformed Singapore from “third world country” into today’s Metropolis. Lee knew that without the natural resources, the country needed to redesign the old Economy model, so he opened the market for foreign investors.

This was a great move, because in 1946, the Chinese Communist revolution happened in Mainland China. After this event, the foreign investors in fear of Comunist influence, eventually moved their investment from Hong Kong and Taiwan into Singapore. After that, Singapore had slowly became one of the largest financial centre in the World.

I’ve learned a lot, reading about Singaporean’s history. It is a beautiful story of proud nation who consistently fights for their freedom and independence. It’s even better that they’ve succeeded so much. It reminds me a bit of Vietnamese history, where Vietnamese people have been fighting for independence for almost 1500 years (check this great short video of Vietnamese history if you are interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5Z0-AsGgM&t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5Z0-AsGgM&t=3s)). I hope Vietnam will learn from countries like Singapore and will succeed as well.

In meantime, enjoy the beautiful view into Singaporean Financial District (downtown).

Thanks for reading and goodnight!
