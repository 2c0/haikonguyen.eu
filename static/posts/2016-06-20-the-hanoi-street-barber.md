During my 5 days in Vietnam, I've seen and experienced so many interesting stories and the one that I am about to share with you guys is just one of them.

Our schedule in Hanoi was pretty tight and my friend wanted to have his haircut done by a professional. At first we wanted to visit some famous Barbershop, but then we saw few of hair dressers doing their magic craft right on the street. My friend told me "Haiko, please let one of these guys cut myhair, they're awesome!" Well, we went there the next day, but unfortunately it was pretty late and all of the street hair stylists went home already. We were starting to lose our hope, but we marched on until we saw a bright light bulb in the middle of the street and our guy was already packing his tools.

We approached him and managed to persuade him to help one more customer. At first my friend was bit worried that the Barber will not be able to deliver. Of course I donâ€™t blame him, because it happens to me in Czech republic as well, but boy oh boy, how wrong we were. This talented young man even exceeded our expectations and gave my friend a very stylish haircut in 20 minutes tops.

During the session he was very happy to have us and told us that he is very lucky to receive a lot of foreign customers. He also mentioned that one day he would like to see Czech republic, but it is very expensive to get the VISA.

It was pleasure to watch this talented artist working and the beautiful result is just a tip of an iceberg. The stylish hairstyle costs us 30000VNDs (around 1 Euro), we were so happy and humbled to meet him and gave him 3 Euros in the end.

We wished him all the best and good luck. If you ever visit Vietnam and want a stylish haircut, definitely give this young street artists a chance, you will not regret it for sure!
