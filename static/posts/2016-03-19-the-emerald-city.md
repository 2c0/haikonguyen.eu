If you ever visit [‪#‎Seattle‬](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/seattle?source=feed_text) and would like to take a picture at the famous [‪#‎Kerry‬](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/kerry?source=feed_text)[‪#‎Park‬](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/park?source=feed_text), I would definitely recommend you to buy an umbrella. Why? Well let’s just say that it’s raining here much more often then what I’m used to in Prague.

The weather here in Seattle is so tricky that there were days that seems to be perfect at first, but just when I arrived at the location to capture the scenery, it’s started to rain. No wonder it shares the same nickname the “[‪#‎Rain‬](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/rain?source=feed_text) [‪#‎City‬](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/city?source=feed_text)” like London in Europe.

In fact, It’s raining even in during Sunny days and according to the local statistics, there are more rainy/cloudy days than sunny days annually.

Well after many attempts, I finally managed to capture the real beautiful landscape of the famous [‪#‎Emerald‬](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/emerald?source=feed_text) #City (Rain City) from the Kerry Park.
