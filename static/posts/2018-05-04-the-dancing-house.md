"The Dancing House is one the most interesting modern architecture in Prague. 
This building became a must see sightseeing monument in Prague and it is truly worth your time 
to come here and snap a shot! To be honest, I’ve taken few shots before, but this time 
I think, it is by far my best try :), and you know what’s funny, I’ve shot this picture using only my iPhone 8 Plus, 
handheld! Enjoy!
