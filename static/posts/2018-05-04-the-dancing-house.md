title: "The Dancing House is one the most interesting modern architecture in Prague. This building became a must see sightseeing monument in Prague and it is truly worth your time to come here and snap a shot! To be honest, I’ve taken few shots before, but this time I think, it is by far my best try :), and you know what’s funny, I’ve shot this picture using only my iPhone 8 Plus, handheld! Enjoy! #prague #travel #iphone8plus #architecture #europe #clouds #blackandwhite #iphoneonly #iphoneography #dancing #house #modern #czechrepublic #czech"
