# Welcome to my new site!

Firstly, I would like to apologize to all my readers, that I was not posting anything, and not letting anyone knows about this. There were so many reasons, and I do not want to go into detail about it now. For short, I was really busy, and I was fed up with the state of my old site. I think that is the main reason, I was not posting anything at all, I even tried to post on Facebook instead and so on. There are so many things I could've done better, but heck, I've learnt from my mistakes :-)!

So to the main topic of this post, after almost a year of analysing, designing and development, I managed to finish a production build of my site! Here, I proudly present you my brand-new site!

# My old site

I created this blog in 2015 during my last days as a student at the University of Economics. During this time, I was really interested in photography and web development. My first post ever, was about photography, you can check it here.

The old DEV stack (web technologies on this site):

- Wordpress
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- MySQL

I've been managing this blog for quite some time now, and at first, it was a joy, and I 've spent countless hours to learn and practice the Wordpress ecosystem, I've become quite familiar with it. I was lucky enough to be able to build many sites based on this system professionally, and personally. Besides, the FRONT-END technologies, I've learnt a bit of the WordPress templating language based on PHP along the way :-).

# Why this new Blog?

Well, after few years spending with the WordPress site, I've found that my blog was getting quite slow for what it does, which is basically only serving my articles for my readers. Plus, it was not so much optimised for mobile devices, and the site was not overall secure, cause it was based on the old http protocol. As a design fan, I wanted to create something of my own, and I think, I did it!

These, are main reasons, that made me to recreate my site:

- Speed
- Security
- Old and not responsive Design
- Learning new technologies along the way :-)

The New DEV stack:

- GatsbyJS
- Styled components
- React
- Material-UI
- GraphQL
- NetlifyCMS and Netlify

# My Process

## Step One - Technical research:

I've been interested in Gatsby for some time, and working as Front-End developer, I got a chance to work on these new technologies in practice while I was working at Starky's Club. In fact, my first project at Starky's, was to rebuild the company's site into Gatsby. If you are interested, you can find the link [here](https://www.starkysclub.com/).

So, one day, when I was researching the Web, I end up at this site [https://www.taniarascia.com/](https://www.taniarascia.com/). This is a personal blog of Tania Rascia, she is an amazing tech writer, self-taught professional software engineer and tutor. When I first saw here page, I was fascinated about the speed of the site, everything was butter-ly smooth and snappy. I've spent quite some time browsing her blog, and you know what, I subscribe immediately. Reading her blog, I've found out that she has quite similar background, which is very close to mine, and I can relate to her, plus her site was exceptional. That day, I told myself, I need to make something like that with my site. Next steps, very pretty easy, I followed her article about migrating WordPress site to Gatsby. Research more about each technology and that was it.

## Step Two - The Design

I am not a Designer by a profession, but for a long time, I really liked the Google's material design. Personally, I think it was made for web, and Google did a great job, creating a masterpiece blueprint. So, I knew in my mind, it should be based on material design. I started to draw some sketches and wireframe, and designed my site based on the Google's [blueprint](https://material.io/design). That's basically my workflow for designing process. 

You can find one of my sketches below, enjoy:

## Step Three - Development

This stage was, as you can guess, the most time-consuming one. The good thing is, that there are so many cool tools, that helped me speed up the process. The Material-UI, which is a React library for Google's Material Design components. This one, is great for rapid UI development, if you know Twitter's Bootstrap, this one is very similar. 

Then, there is the GatsbyJS, which is the main reason, why, I started this all. One of the slogan of Gatsby is "Create blazing fast websites and apps", and I think now, that I've completed the rebuilding process, that this framework really delivers. 

I won't go on details about each technology in the described new DEV stack, but I can tell you, that it was fun and rewarding with very interesting knowledge, which was the main reason that kept me hook to code and finish this site. To be honest, sometimes it was really frustrating and making me go crazy, but after all those nights, with less sleep, it was very worth it. If you are planning to do something similar, I would totally recommend it! Just be patient, and keep coding!

# Summary

Overall, I am very happy, that I've managed to complete this quite time-consuming task. It is one of my accomplishment, that I am very proud of and want to share with you all. The site is not perfect, there are few bugs here and there, by visiting it, you can help me make it better! 

 In the future, I am planning to create more interesting articles about coding, photography, video-making, and so on. 

So, follow me and keep reading! I hope, each of you, will find something interesting!
